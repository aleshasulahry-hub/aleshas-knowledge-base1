# Sisterhood and Womens Circles
## Strength Through Faith and Connection

Women's groups provide a space for shared learning, mutual support, and spiritual growth- helping create a strong sense of sisterhood in the community. These gatherings often include study circles, wellness workshops, social events, and volunteer opportunities that empower women to grow in their faith while building genuine relationships with one another!

  

A beautiful example of this sisterhood is from a nationwide youth-led organization called Young Muslims (YM) sisters. YM creates safe and nurturing spaces for young Muslim women across America. Through weekly halaqas, retreats, and community service projects, YM Sisters helps foster leadership, identity, and faith- based sisterhood. Whether in local masjids or online platforms, YM chapters are active in cities from New Jersey to California, allowing Muslims across America the chance to support one another through the unique challenges they face- while staying grounded in their deen!

>"We aren't just sisters in faith- we show up for each other through everything," said Hafsa, who organizes weekly halaqas.
