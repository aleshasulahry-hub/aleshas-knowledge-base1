title: Mosques in America- Alesha Sulahry

## Mosques in America

There are almost 3,000+ mosques all throughout America, each with its own beauty and history. There are some that are very old, such as the Mother Mosque in Iowa which was built in 1934, and Dar al- Islam in New Mexico, a beautiful mosque which has a fusion of Islamic- Mexican art. I personally find a lot of peace in mosques, whether it is being around dozens or hundreds of Muslims at once praying together or hearing a lecture, or in a completely empty and peaceful room to just reflect and feel connected to my faith. That is why I want to make my project dedicated to finding unique mosques, to learn their history and the way they have brought comfort, peace, and community to Muslims in America!
